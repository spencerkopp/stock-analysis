# Stock-Analysis
The purpose of this project was to refactor VBA code to run more efficiently. Although the original code worked as it should, it took about a second to run and was not as efficient as it could have been.
## Overview of Project
The data most relevant to this project includes 12 stocks' ticker values, total daily volumes, and yearly return, which can be calculated with the opening and closing prices.
### Results of Stock Performance 2017 and 2018
The refactored code produced quicker run times for both the 2017 and 2018 years. The time it took for the code to run for the 2017 year can be found here:

## Cons of Refactoring Code
Refactoring code can be a time consuming process. In refactoring this code, I ran into many new bugs which were not apparent in the previous working code.
### Pros of Refactoring Code
Refactoring this code resulted in significantly faster run times, which means less down time for potential users, as well as requiring less resources to run. It also reduces redundancies of the code.
